Guilty is a tool to extract blame command information from SCM
repositories.

It supports multiple SCM repositories and can provide the information in
different output formats:

 - text: mainly for testing and debugging
 - database: useful for easy querying and generate reports
 - xml: to be used as input for other programs
 - csv: spreadsheet compatible format

For every line of every file guilty provides the following
information:

 - line number:
 - revision: the last revision the line was modified
 - author: the last person who modified the line
 - date: the date of the last modification
 - file: the original file where the line was modified. This value
   will be present only when the line was copied or moved from one
   file to another

Usage:

guilty [options...] URI [files]

URI is the only required parameter and can be a checked out directory,
or a remote URL pointing to a repository. Guilty will analyze the list
of files provided after the URI or it will read files from stdin if
'-' is used instead of filenames. File paths should be relative to the
given repository URI. When analyzing a single file the URI can point
directly to such s file omitting then the file list. If no files are provided
and URI points to a directory, all the files contained in the
directory (and recursively in its subdirectories) will be
analyzed.

Common options:

 -o, --output: output type (text, db, xml, csv)
 -r, --revision: the revision to analyze
 -f, --fast: run faster but moves and copies are not detected
